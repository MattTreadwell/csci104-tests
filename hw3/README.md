# Getting Started

Place these tests in your hw3 folder where you will write your programs

**VERY IMPORTANT:** Make sure that you have your hw2 folder in the same directory as your hw3 folder (should already be this way) since this is how CMake will look for your circular_list_int files from hw2.

# Running

Run the tests using cmake
